In Gradle, we define dependency configurations 
to group dependencies together. A dependency
configuration has a name and several properties,
such as a description and is actually a special
type of FileCollection. Configurations can extend
from each other, so we can build a hierarchy of
configurations in our build files. Gradle plugins
can also add new configurations to our project,
for example, the Java plugin adds several new c
onfigurations, such as compile and testRuntime,
to our project. The compile configuration is then
used to define the dependencies that are needed
to compile our source tree. The dependency configurations
are defined with a configurations configuration block.
Inside the block, we can define new configurations
for our build. All configurations are added to the
project's ConfigurationContainer object.
